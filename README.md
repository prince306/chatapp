IN THIS PROJECCT ,I HAVE USED SOME BASIC CONCEPT OF OOPS AND I HAVE ALSO USED CONCEPT OF JAVA SWING AND ABSTRACT WINDOW TOOLKIT.
IN THIS , I HAVE SIMPLY CREATED TWO FILES AS SERVERSIDE AND CLIENTSIDE.........
THESE SIDE COMMUNICATE USING UNIQUE PORT NO AND ALSO USING IP ADDRESS OF THEIR DEVICES...
THE IP ADDRESS OF SERVERSIDE IS PASTED ON CLIENTSIDE SO THEY CAN COMMUNICATE EASILY........
